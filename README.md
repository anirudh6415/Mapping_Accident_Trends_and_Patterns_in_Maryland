## 📊 Key Visualizations

### 🗺️ Geospatial Map
- Pinpoints accident **hotspots** by severity.
- Hover for accident conditions; toggle markers & legends.
- Identifies **high-risk postal regions**.

### 🍰 Pie Chart Matrix
- Maps **accident severity** by car brand origin and manufacturing year.
- Red border flags fatal cases.
- Hover for percentages.

### 🧱 Mosaic Charts
- Compare **injury severity** by light conditions across two years.
- Select years via dropdown.
- Reveals risk patterns during dawn, dusk, and dark conditions.

### 📊 Stacked Bar Chart Matrix
- Cross-analysis of **weather & light conditions** vs accident count.
- Emphasizes driver fault vs environmental challenges.
- Click to explore **tree maps** for road conditions.

### 🕒 Car-in-a-Clock (Spider Chart)
